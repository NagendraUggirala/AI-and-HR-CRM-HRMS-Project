## 🛠️ Database Configuration

### **Fixed Issues:**
1. **Coding Module Database Connection:**
   - **Problem:** Coding module was trying to load DB credentials from `.env` file
   - **Solution:** Updated `Backend/routers/Candidate_assessments/Assessment/coding/config.py` to import credentials from `core/database.py`
   - **Credentials:** `postgres:4649@localhost:5432/db`

2. **Assignment Status Tracking:**
   - Each assessment completion updates the `Assignment` table
   - Status changes: `"Pending"` → `"In Progress"` → `"Completed"`
   - Results stored in respective tables:
     - Aptitude: `aptitude_assessment_results` table
     - Communication: `communication_assessment_results` table
     - Coding: `coding_assessment_results` table

---

## 📧 Email Configuration

### **Email Function Locations:**
- **Aptitude:** `Backend/routers/Candidate_assessments/Assessment/aptitude/utils.py` → `send_email()`
- **Communication:** `Backend/routers/Candidate_assessments/Assessment/communication/utils_comm.py` → `send_email()`
- **Coding:** `Backend/routers/Candidate_assessments/Assessment/coding/utils.py` → `send_email()`

### **Frontend Base URL:**
- **Environment Variable:** `FRONTEND_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`)
- **Usage:** Auto-generates assessment links in emails

---

## 🎬 How Recruiters Use This System

### **Step 1: Create Assessments in Library**
1. Go to **Assessment Library**
2. Create assessments for each type:
   - Aptitude (25 questions, Medium level)
   - Communication (Reading, Writing, Listening)
   - Coding (2-3 coding problems)

### **Step 2: Assign ONLY Aptitude Test**
1. Go to **Assign Assessments**
2. Select candidate(s)
3. **Assign ONLY the Aptitude assessment** (not all three!)
4. Check "Send Email" option
5. Submit

### **Step 3: Automated Flow Takes Over**
- Candidate receives Aptitude test email
- After passing Aptitude → **System auto-sends Communication link**
- After passing Communication → **System auto-sends Coding link**
- After passing Coding → **System auto-sends Interview link**

### **Step 4: Monitor Progress**
1. Go to **Assignment Status** page
2. View real-time status:
   - Assignment Status: `Pending` / `In Progress` / `Completed`
   - Test Result: `Qualified` / `Regret`
   - Score: Displayed for each assessment
3. Click **"View Details"** for comprehensive information
